# iCaRL: Incremental Classifier and Representation Learning [(CVPR'2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07725)



## Abstract

A major open problem on the road to artificial intelligence is the development of incrementally learning systems that learn about more and more concepts over time from a stream of data. In this work, we introduce a new training strategy, iCaRL, that allows learning in such a class-incremental way: only the training data for a small number of classes has to be present at the same time and new classes can be added progressively.

iCaRL learns strong classifiers and a data representation simultaneously. This distinguishes it from earlier works that were fundamentally limited to fixed data representations and therefore incompatible with deep learning architectures. We show by experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet ILSVRC 2012 data that iCaRL can learn many classes incrementally over a long period of time where other strategies quickly fail.

## How to Reproduce iCaRL

It consists of two steps:

* **Step1: Modify Configuration**

  * Modify the configuration in the `run_trainer.py` file to `"./config/icarl cifar100.yaml"`.

  * Example: `config = Config("./config/icarl cifar100.yaml").get_config_dict()`

* **Step2: Run the trainer file**

  * Execute the following commandï¼š`python run_trainer.py`
